# SAFE App Icon

This directory contains the app icon for the SAFE (Silent Assistance for Emergencies) application.

## Required Icon:
- **File Name**: `safe_app_icon.png`
- **Size**: 1024x1024 pixels (minimum)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Design**: Should represent the SAFE app theme - emergency assistance, safety, shield, etc.

## Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use high contrast colors that work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Include elements that suggest safety, emergency, or assistance
- Consider using a shield icon with emergency symbols
- Colors should align with the app's gradient theme (blue-violet to soft violet)

## After adding your icon:
1. Place your `safe_app_icon.png` file in this directory
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main` to generate all icon sizes
4. Build your app to see the new icon

## Current Status:
- [ ] Custom icon file added
- [ ] Icon generated for all platforms
- [ ] App tested with new icon
