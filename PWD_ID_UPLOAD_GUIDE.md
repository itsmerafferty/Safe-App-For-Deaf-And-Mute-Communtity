# PWD ID Front & Back Upload Feature

## Overview
Updated the Medical ID registration screen to support uploading **both front and back photos** of PWD ID for better verification.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated State Variables
**File:** `lib/medical_id_screen.dart`

Changed from single PWD ID photo to separate front and back:
```dart
// Before:
String? _pwdIdImagePath;

// After:
String? _pwdIdFrontImagePath;
String? _pwdIdBackImagePath;
```

### 2. Separate Upload Sections

#### PWD ID Front Upload
- **Title:** "PWD ID - Front (For verification)"
- **Upload Button:** "Upload PWD ID Front Photo"
- **Success Message:** "PWD ID Front Uploaded"
- **Help Text:** "Upload a clear photo of the front of your PWD ID"

#### PWD ID Back Upload
- **Title:** "PWD ID - Back (For verification)"
- **Upload Button:** "Upload PWD ID Back Photo"
- **Success Message:** "PWD ID Back Uploaded"
- **Help Text:** "Upload a clear photo of the back of your PWD ID for emergency verification"

### 3. Enhanced Image Selection Dialog

Updated `_selectPwdIdImage()` function to accept `isFront` parameter:
```dart
void _selectPwdIdImage({required bool isFront})
```

**Features:**
- Dynamic dialog title based on front/back selection
- Two upload options:
  1. **Take Photo** - Capture with camera
  2. **Choose from Gallery** - Select existing photo
- Separate file paths for front and back photos
- Success notifications for each upload

### 4. User Interface

Each upload section includes:
- ✅ **Upload State:** Dashed border box with upload icon
- ✅ **Uploaded State:** Solid background with success icon
- ✅ **Remove Button:** Red X button to clear uploaded image
- ✅ **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded icons (gray → red when uploaded)
- ✅ **Help Text:** Clear instructions for users

### 5. Validation Ready

Both front and back photos can be validated separately before proceeding to the next step.

## User Flow

1. User navigates to Medical ID registration screen (Step 3)
2. Scrolls to PWD ID section
3. Taps "Upload PWD ID Front Photo"
4. Chooses "Take Photo" or "Choose from Gallery"
5. Front photo is uploaded and displayed
6. Taps "Upload PWD ID Back Photo"
7. Chooses upload method for back photo
8. Back photo is uploaded and displayed
9. Both photos can be removed and re-uploaded if needed
10. Proceeds to complete registration
