**How to Test:**
1. Run the app on real device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. Go to "Forgot Password" screen

3. Enter phone number:
   - Format: `09171234567` (automatically converts to +63)
   - Or: `+639171234567`

4. Click "Send Verification"

5. Check your phone for SMS with 6-digit OTP

6. Enter the OTP code

7. Should show success message!
