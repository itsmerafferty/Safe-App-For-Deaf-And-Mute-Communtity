# Google Maps API Key Setup - FREE Solution 🗺️

## 🎯 Problem

**Error:** "This page didn't load Google Maps correctly"

**Cause:** Missing or invalid Google Maps API key

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 1: Get FREE Google Maps API Key (Recommended)

Google Maps provides **$200 FREE credits per month** which is more than enough for your admin dashboard!

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console

1. **Visit:** https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Login** with your Google account (same as Firebase)
3. **Select project:** `safe-emergency-app-f4c17`

### Step 2: Enable Maps JavaScript API

1. **Go to APIs & Services:**
   - Left menu → "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Or direct link: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library

2. **Search for "Maps JavaScript API"**
   - Click on "Maps JavaScript API"
   - Click **"ENABLE"** button

### Step 3: Create API Key

1. **Go to Credentials:**
   - Left menu → "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Or: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

2. **Create Credentials:**
   - Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at top
   - Select "API key"
   - Copy the API key that appears

3. **Restrict the API key (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Click on the newly created key
   - Under "API restrictions":
     - Select "Restrict key"
     - Check only: "Maps JavaScript API"
   - Under "Website restrictions":
     - Select "HTTP referrers"
     - Add: `localhost:*`
     - Add: `*.web.app/*` (for Firebase Hosting)
     - Add: `*.firebaseapp.com/*`
   - Click "Save"

### Step 4: Update Your Code

Copy your API key and update `index.html`:

**File:** `safe_admin_web/web/index.html`

Replace this line:
```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBxJQz7xVzR9pCKXf8KZ7vZ3nVhF7Ql8gM"></script>
```

With your new key:
```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE"></script>
```

### Step 5: Rebuild & Test

```powershell
cd "d:\Safe Mobile app system\safe_application_for_deafandmute\safe_admin_web"
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Maps should work now!** ✅

## ✅ SOLUTION 2: Alternative - Use OpenStreetMap (100% Free)

### Advantages:
- ✅ **100% FREE** - No API key needed
- ✅ **No limits** - Unlimited map loads
- ✅ **No billing** - Never get charged
- ✅ **Open source** - Community maintained

### Implementation:

This requires more code changes. Would you like me to implement this instead?

For now, I can also just show emergency locations in a simple list format without map.

**Don't worry about costs!**

- **$200 FREE** credits per month
- **28,000+ map loads** per month free
- Your admin dashboard will use maybe 100-500 loads/month
- **You won't be charged** unless you exceed limits
