## Emergency Report Status Workflow

```
┌─────────┐
│ PENDING │  ← User submits emergency
└────┬────┘
     │
     ├──────────→ [Mark as Ongoing]
     │           ↓
     │        ┌──────────┐
     │        │ ONGOING  │  ← Responders addressing
     │        └────┬─────┘

     └──────────→ [Resolve Now (direct)]
                  ↓
                ┌──────────┐
                │ RESOLVED │  ← Emergency completed
                └──────────┘
```

### Status Definitions:

1. **PENDING** 🟠
   - New emergency just submitted

   - PDAO can:
     * Mark as Ongoing (responders dispatched)
     * Resolve Now (false alarm or quick resolution)

2. **ONGOING** 🔴
   - Responders are currently addressing the emergency
   - Active emergency situation
   - PDAO can:
     * Mark as Resolved (when completed)

3. **RESOLVED** 🟢
   - Emergency successfully addressed
   - Final status - no further actions
   - Archived for records

## Data Structure Updates

    "userId": "user123",
    "userEmail": "user@example.com",
    "category": "Medical",
    "subcategory": "Heart Attack",
    "status": "pending | ongoing | resolved",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-21T10:30:00Z",
    "ongoingAt": "2025-10-21T10:35:00Z",      // When marked as ongoing
    "resolvedAt": "2025-10-21T11:00:00Z",      // When marked as resolved
    "location": {
      "latitude": 16.153456,
      "longitude": 119.979789,
      "address": "123 Main St, Alaminos, Pangasinan"

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **`safe_admin_web/lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`**
   - Added emergency report counters
   - Separated statistics into two sections
   - Updated quick actions card

2. **`safe_admin_web/lib/screens/emergency_reports_screen.dart`**
   - Added "Ongoing" filter tab
   - Added `_handleOngoing()` method
   - Updated action buttons logic
   - Different actions for pending vs ongoing

### New State Variables:
```dart

```

### Statistics Query Logic:
```dart
// Count emergency reports by status
for (var doc in emergencySnapshot.docs) {
  final data = doc.data();
  final status = data['status'] as String? ?? 'pending';
  
  if (status == 'pending') pendingEmergency++;
  else if (status == 'ongoing') ongoingEmergency++;
  else if (status == 'resolved') resolvedEmergency++;
}
```

## API Reference

### New Methods:

#### `_handleOngoing(String reportId)`
Marks a pending emergency as ongoing.

```dart
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('emergency_reports')
    .doc(reportId)
    .update({
  'status': 'ongoing',
  'ongoingAt': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});
```

#### `_handleResolve(String reportId)`
Marks an emergency as resolved (from pending or ongoing).

```dart
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('emergency_reports')
    .doc(reportId)
    .update({
  'status': 'resolved',
  'resolvedAt': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Statistics not updating
**Solution**: 
- Check Firestore connection
- Verify `status` field in emergency_reports collection
- Call `_loadStatistics()` manually with refresh button

### Issue: Wrong count in dashboard
**Solution**:
- Ensure all reports have valid `status` field
- Check for typos: 'pending', 'ongoing', 'resolved' (lowercase)
- Run Firestore query manually to verify data

### Issue: Action buttons not working
**Solution**:
- Check Firestore write permissions
- Verify document ID is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Review browser console for errors
