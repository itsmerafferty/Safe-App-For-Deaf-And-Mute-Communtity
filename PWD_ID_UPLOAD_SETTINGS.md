## 🔐 Security

### Firebase Storage Rules
```javascript
match /pwdId/{userId}/{fileName} {
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow read: if request.auth != null && (
    request.auth.uid == userId ||
    request.auth.token.email.matches('.*admin.*')
  );
}
```

- Users can only upload their own PWD IDs
- Users and admins can view PWD IDs
